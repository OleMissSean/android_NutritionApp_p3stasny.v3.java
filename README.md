Mobile Application Development
Programming Assignment #3
Spring 2015
Due: Thursday,April 9th at Midnight.

For this assignment, there is no specific application to develop.
You are asked to demonstrate that you understand and can implement a set of Android concepts in a single application of your choosing.
It might be helpful if you use this programming assignment as a start toward figuring out pieces of your final class project.
Or you can use the money tracking example from the last quiz/lab.

Develop a single application (you choose the domain) that demonstrates the use of at least five of the following Android concepts.
Plus, you should also include one extra concept of your choice, so long as it isn’t something basic that we have already covered.
It is probably best to clear it with me before you count on using a different concept.

• Action Bar
• Long Press
• ListView
• Dynamic UI
• Fragment (or DialogFragment)
• Drawable
• Database
• SharedPreferences

Upload a single zip file to Blackboard, Prog3.
The file should that contains the whole project and a README.
The README is very important this time so put some extra effort into it.
In the README, explain which of the concepts you implemented, why that feature makes sense to use the way you did, and any resources you consulted to figure out how to use it.
